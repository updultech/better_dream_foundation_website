## 🚨 Common Test Scenarios

### Error Handling
1. **Try submitting empty forms** - Should show error messages
2. **Enter invalid email** - Should validate email format
3. **Enter invalid year** - Should reject years outside reasonable range
4. **Cancel form submission** - Should close dialog without saving

### Edge Cases
1. **Very long text** - Test with lengthy descriptions and content
2. **Special characters** - Use quotes, apostrophes, and symbols
3. **Multiple rapid clicks** - Test button responsiveness
4. **Browser refresh** - Check if changes persist (note: this is demo data)

### Workflow Testing
1. **Create → Edit → Delete cycle** for each content type
2. **Switch between tabs** while forms are open
3. **Change status** from Draft to Published and vice versa
4. **Bulk operations** - Add multiple items quickly

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### Responsive Behavior
- ✅ **Touch-friendly buttons** - Easy to tap on mobile
- ✅ **Readable text** - Proper font sizes on small screens
- ✅ **Scrollable forms** - Long forms work on mobile
- ✅ **Accessible navigation** - Tab switching works on touch devices

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After testing, you should be able to:
- ✅ **Add new content** in all four sections
- ✅ **Edit existing content** with pre-filled forms
- ✅ **Delete content** with proper confirmations
- ✅ **See real-time feedback** for all actions
- ✅ **Navigate smoothly** between different sections
- ✅ **Experience responsive design** on different screen sizes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If something doesn't work:
1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Refresh the page** and try again
3. **Clear browser cache** if forms seem stuck
4. **Try different browser** to isolate issues
5. **Check network connection** for any loading problems

### Expected Limitations:
- **Data is temporary** - Refreshing the page resets to demo data
- **File uploads** - Currently shows file input but doesn't process files
- **External links** - Preview buttons open placeholder pages
- **Authentication** - Uses simple localStorage (not production-ready)

This testing guide ensures all admin functionality works as expected before deploying to production!
